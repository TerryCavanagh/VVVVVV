 *
 * PhysicsFS; a portable, flexible file i/o abstraction.
 *
 * This API gives you access to a system file system in ways superior to the
 *  stdio or system i/o calls. The brief benefits:
 *
 *   - It's portable.
 *   - It's safe. No file access is permitted outside the specified dirs.
 *   - It's flexible. Archives (.ZIP files) can be used transparently as
 *      directory structures.
 *
 * With PhysicsFS, you have a single writing directory and multiple
 *  directories (the "search path") for reading. You can think of this as a
 *  filesystem within a filesystem. If (on Windows) you were to set the
 *  writing directory to "C:\MyGame\MyWritingDirectory", then no PHYSFS calls
 *  could touch anything above this directory, including the "C:\MyGame" and
 *  "C:\" directories. This prevents an application's internal scripting
 *  language from piddling over c:\\config.sys, for example. If you'd rather
 *  give PHYSFS full access to the system's REAL file system, set the writing
 *  dir to "C:\", but that's generally A Bad Thing for several reasons.
 *
 * Drive letters are hidden in PhysicsFS once you set up your initial paths.
 *  The search path creates a single, hierarchical directory structure.
 *  Not only does this lend itself well to general abstraction with archives,
 *  it also gives better support to operating systems like MacOS and Unix.
 *  Generally speaking, you shouldn't ever hardcode a drive letter; not only
 *  does this hurt portability to non-Microsoft OSes, but it limits your win32
 *  users to a single drive, too. Use the PhysicsFS abstraction functions and
 *  allow user-defined configuration options, too. When opening a file, you
 *  specify it like it was on a Unix filesystem: if you want to write to
 *  "C:\MyGame\MyConfigFiles\game.cfg", then you might set the write dir to
 *  "C:\MyGame" and then open "MyConfigFiles/game.cfg". This gives an
 *  abstraction across all platforms. Specifying a file in this way is termed
 *  "platform-independent notation" in this documentation. Specifying a
 *  a filename in a form such as "C:\mydir\myfile" or
 *  "MacOS hard drive:My Directory:My File" is termed "platform-dependent
 *  notation". The only time you use platform-dependent notation is when
 *  setting up your write directory and search path; after that, all file
 *  access into those directories are done with platform-independent notation.
 *
 * All files opened for writing are opened in relation to the write directory,
 *  which is the root of the writable filesystem. When opening a file for
 *  reading, PhysicsFS goes through the search path. This is NOT the
 *  same thing as the PATH environment variable. An application using
 *  PhysicsFS specifies directories to be searched which may be actual
 *  directories, or archive files that contain files and subdirectories of
 *  their own. See the end of these docs for currently supported archive
 *  formats.
 *
 * Once the search path is defined, you may open files for reading. If you've
 *  got the following search path defined (to use a win32 example again):
 *
 *  - C:\\mygame
 *  - C:\\mygame\\myuserfiles
 *  - D:\\mygamescdromdatafiles
 *  - C:\\mygame\\installeddatafiles.zip
 *
 * Then a call to PHYSFS_openRead("textfiles/myfile.txt") (note the directory
 *  separator, lack of drive letter, and lack of dir separator at the start of
 *  the string; this is platform-independent notation) will check for
 *  C:\\mygame\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then
 *  C:\\mygame\\myuserfiles\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then
 *  D:\\mygamescdromdatafiles\\textfiles\\myfile.txt, then, finally, for
 *  textfiles\\myfile.txt inside of C:\\mygame\\installeddatafiles.zip.
 *  Remember that most archive types and platform filesystems store their
 *  filenames in a case-sensitive manner, so you should be careful to specify
 *  it correctly.
 *
 * Files opened through PhysicsFS may NOT contain "." or ".." or ":" as dir
 *  elements. Not only are these meaningless on MacOS Classic and/or Unix,
 *  they are a security hole. Also, symbolic links (which can be found in
 *  some archive types and directly in the filesystem on Unix platforms) are
 *  NOT followed until you call PHYSFS_permitSymbolicLinks(). That's left to
 *  your own discretion, as following a symlink can allow for access outside
 *  the write dir and search paths. For portability, there is no mechanism for
 *  creating new symlinks in PhysicsFS.
 *
 * The write dir is not included in the search path unless you specifically
 *  add it. While you CAN change the write dir as many times as you like,
 *  you should probably set it once and stick to it. Remember that your
 *  program will not have permission to write in every directory on Unix and
 *  NT systems.
 *
 * All files are opened in binary mode; there is no endline conversion for
 *  textfiles. Other than that, PhysicsFS has some convenience functions for
 *  platform-independence. There is a function to tell you the current
 *  platform's dir separator ("\\" on windows, "/" on Unix, ":" on MacOS),
 *  which is needed only to set up your search/write paths. There is a
 *  function to tell you what CD-ROM drives contain accessible discs, and a
 *  function to recommend a good search path, etc.
 *
 * A recommended order for the search path is the write dir, then the base dir,
 *  then the cdrom dir, then any archives discovered. Quake 3 does something
 *  like this, but moves the archives to the start of the search path. Build
 *  Engine games, like Duke Nukem 3D and Blood, place the archives last, and
 *  use the base dir for both searching and writing. There is a helper
 *  function (PHYSFS_setSaneConfig()) that puts together a basic configuration
 *  for you, based on a few parameters. Also see the comments on
 *  PHYSFS_getBaseDir(), and PHYSFS_getPrefDir() for info on what those
 *  are and how they can help you determine an optimal search path.
 *
 * PhysicsFS 2.0 adds the concept of "mounting" archives to arbitrary points
 *  in the search path. If a zipfile contains "maps/level.map" and you mount
 *  that archive at "mods/mymod", then you would have to open
 *  "mods/mymod/maps/level.map" to access the file, even though "mods/mymod"
 *  isn't actually specified in the .zip file. Unlike the Unix mentality of
 *  mounting a filesystem, "mods/mymod" doesn't actually have to exist when
 *  mounting the zipfile. It's a "virtual" directory. The mounting mechanism
 *  allows the developer to seperate archives in the tree and avoid trampling
 *  over files when added new archives, such as including mod support in a
 *  game...keeping external content on a tight leash in this manner can be of
 *  utmost importance to some applications.
 *
 * PhysicsFS is mostly thread safe. The errors returned by
 *  PHYSFS_getLastErrorCode() are unique by thread, and library-state-setting
 *  functions are mutex'd. For efficiency, individual file accesses are 
 *  not locked, so you can not safely read/write/seek/close/etc the same 
 *  file from two threads at the same time. Other race conditions are bugs 
 *  that should be reported/patched.
 *
 * While you CAN use stdio/syscall file access in a program that has PHYSFS_*
 *  calls, doing so is not recommended, and you can not directly use system
 *  filehandles with PhysicsFS and vice versa (but as of PhysicsFS 2.1, you
 *  can wrap them in a PHYSFS_Io interface yourself if you wanted to).
 *
 * Note that archives need not be named as such: if you have a ZIP file and
 *  rename it with a .PKG extension, the file will still be recognized as a
 *  ZIP archive by PhysicsFS; the file's contents are used to determine its
 *  type where possible.
 *
 * Currently supported archive types:
 *   - .ZIP (pkZip/WinZip/Info-ZIP compatible)
 *   - .7Z  (7zip archives)
 *   - .ISO (ISO9660 files, CD-ROM images)
 *   - .GRP (Build Engine groupfile archives)
 *   - .PAK (Quake I/II archive format)
 *   - .HOG (Descent I/II HOG file archives)
 *   - .MVL (Descent II movielib archives)
 *   - .WAD (DOOM engine archives)
 *   - .VDF (Gothic I/II engine archives)
 *   - .SLB (Independence War archives)
 *
 * String policy for PhysicsFS 2.0 and later:
 *
 * PhysicsFS 1.0 could only deal with null-terminated ASCII strings. All high
 *  ASCII chars resulted in undefined behaviour, and there was no Unicode
 *  support at all. PhysicsFS 2.0 supports Unicode without breaking binary
 *  compatibility with the 1.0 API by using UTF-8 encoding of all strings
 *  passed in and out of the library.
 *
 * All strings passed through PhysicsFS are in null-terminated UTF-8 format.
 *  This means that if all you care about is English (ASCII characters <= 127)
 *  then you just use regular C strings. If you care about Unicode (and you
 *  should!) then you need to figure out what your platform wants, needs, and
 *  offers. If you are on Windows before Win2000 and build with Unicode
 *  support, your TCHAR strings are two bytes per character (this is called
 *  "UCS-2 encoding"). Any modern Windows uses UTF-16, which is two bytes
 *  per character for most characters, but some characters are four. You
 *  should convert them to UTF-8 before handing them to PhysicsFS with
 *  PHYSFS_utf8FromUtf16(), which handles both UTF-16 and UCS-2. If you're
 *  using Unix or Mac OS X, your wchar_t strings are four bytes per character
 *  ("UCS-4 encoding", sometimes called "UTF-32"). Use PHYSFS_utf8FromUcs4().
 *  Mac OS X can give you UTF-8 directly from a CFString or NSString, and many
 *  Unixes generally give you C strings in UTF-8 format everywhere. If you
 *  have a single-byte high ASCII charset, like so-many European "codepages"
 *  you may be out of luck. We'll convert from "Latin1" to UTF-8 only, and
 *  never back to Latin1. If you're above ASCII 127, all bets are off: move
 *  to Unicode or use your platform's facilities. Passing a C string with
 *  high-ASCII data that isn't UTF-8 encoded will NOT do what you expect!
 *
 * Naturally, there's also PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs2(), PHYSFS_utf8ToUtf16(), and
 *  PHYSFS_utf8ToUcs4() to get data back into a format you like. Behind the
 *  scenes, PhysicsFS will use Unicode where possible: the UTF-8 strings on
 *  Windows will be converted and used with the multibyte Windows APIs, for
 *  example.
 *
 * PhysicsFS offers basic encoding conversion support, but not a whole string
 *  library. Get your stuff into whatever format you can work with.
 *
 * Most platforms supported by PhysicsFS 2.1 and later fully support Unicode.
 *  Some older platforms have been dropped (Windows 95, Mac OS 9). Some, like
 *  OS/2, might be able to convert to a local codepage or will just fail to
 *  open/create the file. Modern OSes (macOS, Linux, Windows, etc) should all
 *  be fine.
 *
 * Many game-specific archivers are seriously unprepared for Unicode (the
 *  Descent HOG/MVL and Build Engine GRP archivers, for example, only offer a
 *  DOS 8.3 filename, for example). Nothing can be done for these, but they
 *  tend to be legacy formats for existing content that was all ASCII (and
 *  thus, valid UTF-8) anyhow. Other formats, like .ZIP, don't explicitly
 *  offer Unicode support, but unofficially expect filenames to be UTF-8
 *  encoded, and thus Just Work. Most everything does the right thing without
 *  bothering you, but it's good to be aware of these nuances in case they
 *  don't.

 *          This was meant to be a human-readable string in one of several

 *          to (poorly) maintain a significant amount of localization work.
 *          The app couldn't parse the strings, even if they counted on a
 *          specific language, since some were dynamically generated.
 *          In 2.1 and later, this always returns a static string in
 *          English; you may use it as a key string for your own

 *          existing error strings. Also, if your application wants to

 *          use PHYSFS_getLastErrorCode() instead.
 *
 * Get the last PhysicsFS error message as a human-readable, null-terminated
 *  string. This will return NULL if there's been no error since the last call
 *  to this function. The pointer returned by this call points to an internal
 *  buffer. Each thread has a unique error state associated with it, but each
 *  time a new error message is set, it will overwrite the previous one
 *  associated with that thread. It is safe to call this function at anytime,

 *  or had a serious error and couldn't alert anyone. Furthermore, if
 *  PhysicsFS itself had a problem (disk error or whatnot), it couldn't report

 * \brief An abstract i/o interface.
 *
 * \warning This is advanced, hardcore stuff. You don't need this unless you
 *          really know what you're doing. Most apps will not need this.
 *
 * Historically, PhysicsFS provided access to the physical filesystem and
 *  archives within that filesystem. However, sometimes you need more power
 *  than this. Perhaps you need to provide an archive that is entirely
 *  contained in RAM, or you need to bridge some other file i/o API to
 *  PhysicsFS, or you need to translate the bits (perhaps you have a
 *  a standard .zip file that's encrypted, and you need to decrypt on the fly
 *  for the unsuspecting zip archiver).
 *
 * A PHYSFS_Io is the interface that Archivers use to get archive data.
 *  Historically, this has mapped to file i/o to the physical filesystem, but
 *  as of PhysicsFS 2.1, applications can provide their own i/o implementations
 *  at runtime.
 *
 * This interface isn't necessarily a good universal fit for i/o. There are a
 *  few requirements of note:
 *
 *  - They only do blocking i/o (at least, for now).
 *  - They need to be able to duplicate. If you have a file handle from
 *    fopen(), you need to be able to create a unique clone of it (so we
 *    have two handles to the same file that can both seek/read/etc without
 *    stepping on each other).
 *  - They need to know the size of their entire data set.
 *  - They need to be able to seek and rewind on demand.
 *
 * ...in short, you're probably not going to write an HTTP implementation.
 *
 * Thread safety: PHYSFS_Io implementations are not guaranteed to be thread
 *  safe in themselves. Under the hood where PhysicsFS uses them, the library
 *  provides its own locks. If you plan to use them directly from separate
 *  threads, you should either use mutexes to protect them, or don't use the
 *  same PHYSFS_Io from two threads at the same time.

 *    - Always use a unique app string for each one, and make sure it never
 *      changes for an app once you've decided on it.
 *    - Unicode characters are legal, as long as it's UTF-8 encoded, but...
 *    - ...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like
 *      "Game Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.
 *
 * The pointer returned by this function remains valid until you call this
 *  function again, or call PHYSFS_deinit(). This is not necessarily a fast
 *  call, though, so you should call this once at startup and copy the string
 *  if you need it.
 *
 * You should assume the path returned by this function is the only safe
 *  place to write files (and that PHYSFS_getUserDir() and PHYSFS_getBaseDir(),
 *  while they might be writable, or even parents of the returned path, aren't
 *  where you should be writing things).
 *
 *   \param org The name of your organization.
 *   \param app The name of your application.
 *  \return READ ONLY string of user dir in platform-dependent notation. NULL
 *          if there's a problem (creating directory failed, etc).

/**
 * \struct PHYSFS_Archiver
 * \brief Abstract interface to provide support for user-defined archives.
 *
 * \warning This is advanced, hardcore stuff. You don't need this unless you
 *          really know what you're doing. Most apps will not need this.
 *
 * Historically, PhysicsFS provided a means to mount various archive file
 *  formats, and physical directories in the native filesystem. However,
 *  applications have been limited to the file formats provided by the
 *  library. This interface allows an application to provide their own
 *  archive file types.
 *
 * Conceptually, a PHYSFS_Archiver provides directory entries, while
 *  PHYSFS_Io provides data streams for those directory entries. The most
 *  obvious use of PHYSFS_Archiver is to provide support for an archive
 *  file type that isn't provided by PhysicsFS directly: perhaps some
 *  proprietary format that only your application needs to understand.
 *
 * Internally, all the built-in archive support uses this interface, so the
 *  best examples for building a PHYSFS_Archiver is the source code to
 *  PhysicsFS itself.
 *
 * An archiver is added to the system with PHYSFS_registerArchiver(), and then
 *  it will be available for use automatically with PHYSFS_mount(); if a
 *  given archive can be handled with your archiver, it will be given control
 *  as appropriate.
 *
 * These methods deal with dir handles. You have one instance of your
 *  archiver, and it generates a unique, opaque handle for each opened
 *  archive in its openArchive() method. Since the lifetime of an Archiver
 *  (not an archive) is generally the entire lifetime of the process, and it's
 *  assumed to be a singleton, we do not provide any instance data for the
 *  archiver itself; the app can just use some static variables if necessary.
 *
 * Symlinks should always be followed (except in stat()); PhysicsFS will
 *  use the stat() method to check for symlinks and make a judgement on
 *  whether to continue to call other methods based on that.
 *
 * Archivers, when necessary, should set the PhysicsFS error state with
 *  PHYSFS_setErrorCode() before returning. PhysicsFS will pass these errors
 *  back to the application unmolested in most cases.
 *
 * Thread safety: PHYSFS_Archiver implementations are not guaranteed to be
 *  thread safe in themselves. PhysicsFS provides thread safety when it calls
 *  into a given archiver inside the library, but it does not promise that
 *  using the same PHYSFS_File from two threads at once is thread-safe; as
 *  such, your PHYSFS_Archiver can assume that locking is handled for you
 *  so long as the PHYSFS_Io you return from PHYSFS_open* doesn't change any
 *  of your Archiver state, as the PHYSFS_Io won't be as aggressively
 *  protected.
 *
