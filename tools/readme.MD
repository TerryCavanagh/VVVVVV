This folder contains the source code to small, custom level editing tools that I used when originally creating VVVVVV! They're included here for the sake of completeness. 

These are the tool that exported levels as source code for use in the game. The different versions were quick copy and paste forks for different areas in the game - they're mostly the same, but some versions had slight changes made for situations unique to those areas.

These tools were never meant to be used by anybody else, and I don't recommend wasting too much time with them. If you're interested in further development with VVVVVV, a more promising and future facing direction to explore is the built in level editor and the external .vvvvvv level file format, originally added in 2011 for the C++ port.

If you do want to compile them, you'll need Allegro v4.3 and probably a lot of patience and trial and error to figure out how they all work. Good luck!
