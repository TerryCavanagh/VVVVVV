This is the source code to VVVVVV, the 2010 indie game by [Terry Cavanagh](http://distractionware.com/), with music by [Magnus Pålsson](http://souleye.madtracker.net/). You can read the [announcement](http://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/) of the source code release on Terry's blog!

VVVVVV is still commerically available at [thelettervsixtim.es](https://thelettervsixtim.es/) if you'd like to support it, but you are completely free to compile the game for your own personal use.
