This is the source code for the Adobe Air mobile version of VVVVVV, which is forked from the original flash source code. This version is not maintained, and is only included here for those curious. If you're looking for the current, maintained C++ version, it's [in this folder](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/tree/master/desktop_version).

The mobile version needs a different data.zip folder, which [can be downloaded from here](https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/). Just like the asset contents from the C++ version, the contents of this folder are still under a proprietary license.

Requires Adobe AIR, targeting SWF version 36.
