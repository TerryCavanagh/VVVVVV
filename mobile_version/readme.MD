This is the source code for the adobe air mobile version of VVVVVV, which is forked from the original flash source code.

The mobile version needs a different data.zip folder, which [can be downloaded from here](https://thelettervsixtim.es/opensource/vvvvvv%20mobile%20data%20folder.zip). Just like the asset contents from the C++ version, the contents of this folder are still under a proprietary license.

Requires Adobe AIR, targeting SWF version 36.
